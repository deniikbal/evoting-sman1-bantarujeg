## 1. Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive set of security guidelines tailored to the `evoting-sman1-bantarujeg` repository. By adhering to these principles, your e-voting system will be robust, maintainable, and resistant to common attack vectors.

## 2. Security by Design & Secure Defaults
- **Embed Security from Day One**: Incorporate threat modeling during feature design (e.g., voting flow, token generation).
- **Least Privilege**: Assign minimal database privileges to each role:
  - Admin user: read/write on `students`, `tokens`, `candidates`, `votes`, and settings tables only.
  - Student user: read-only on `candidates`, write-only on `votes` (protected by business logic).
- **Defense in Depth**: Layer controls with API-level checks, database constraints, and UI restrictions.
- **Fail Securely**: On any error (e.g., DB unavailability), display generic messages and log details securely.

## 3. Authentication & Access Control
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for Admins
   - Integrate TOTP or SMS/Email codes for administrator logins.
2. **Student Login via NIS & Token**
   - Validate NIS against `students` table.
   - Verify `tokens.is_used = false` and `expires_at > now()`.
   - Immediately mark token as used within a transaction to prevent replay.
3. **Password & Token Storage**
   - Admin passwords: hash with Argon2id or bcrypt + unique salt.
   - Student tokens: store as salted hashes (e.g., HMAC+SHA256) to prevent plain-text leaks.
4. **Session Management**
   - Use secure, HTTP-Only, SameSite=strict cookies with short expiration.
   - Protect against session fixation by rotating session IDs on login.
5. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Enforce server-side checks on every protected API route (e.g., `/api/vote`, `/api/students`).
   - Deny by default; authorize only explicit actions.

## 4. Input Handling & Processing
- **Server-Side Validation**
  - Use Zod or Joi schemas for all request payloads (login, vote submission, candidate CRUD).
- **Prevent Injection**
  - Continue leveraging Drizzle ORM’s parameterized queries.
  - Reject or sanitize any raw SQL/NoSQL queries.
- **XSS Mitigation**
  - Escape all user-supplied data in React components (e.g., candidate names).
  - Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) via HTTP headers.
- **CSRF Protection**
  - Apply anti-CSRF tokens on all state-changing POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints.
- **File Uploads** (if any)
  - Validate file types and sizes, store outside the webroot, and set restrictive permissions.

## 5. Data Protection & Privacy
- **Encryption**
  - Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all web traffic (HSTS, strong ciphers).
  - Postgres connections should use SSL and verify certificates.
- **Secrets Management**
  - Store DB credentials and JWT secrets in a managed vault (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) instead of `.env`.
- **Logging & Error Messages**
  - Avoid leaking PII or internal paths in logs or error responses.
  - Use structured logging with redaction for sensitive fields.
- **Data Retention & Deletion**
  - Define a policy for archiving or purging old election data in accordance with local regulations (GDPR, CCPA).

## 6. API & Service Security
- **HTTPS Everywhere**
  - Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS at the load-balancer or reverse proxy.
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling**
  - Implement per-IP and per-account rate limits on critical endpoints (`/api/auth`, `/api/vote`).
- **CORS Configuration**
  - Restrict allowed origins to your official domains. Disable wildcard (`*`).
- **Versioning & Deprecation**
  - Prefix API routes with `/api/v1/…` to future-proof breaking changes.
- **Minimal Data Exposure**
  - Return only necessary fields in API responses (e.g., candidate ID/name, no internal metadata).

## 7. Web Application Security Hygiene
- **Security Headers**
  - `Content-Security-Policy`: disallow inline scripts; whitelist trusted sources.
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`: `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`.
  - `X-Frame-Options`: `DENY` to prevent clickjacking.
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`: `nosniff`.
  - `Referrer-Policy`: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.
- **Secure Cookies**
  - Set `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` on session cookies.
- **Avoid Client-Side Secrets**
  - Never store tokens or credentials in `localStorage`/`sessionStorage`.
- **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**
  - Add integrity hashes for any CDN-hosted scripts or styles.

## 8. Infrastructure & Configuration Management
- **Server Hardening**
  - Disable unused services; remove default accounts.
  - Apply OS and dependency patches regularly.
- **Network Controls**
  - Use firewalls/security groups to expose only ports 80/443 and database port (from trusted host).
- **TLS Configuration**
  - Disable TLS 1.0/1.1; prefer ECDHE + AES/GCM ciphers.
- **Least Privilege in CI/CD**
  - Ensure build agents and deployment pipelines have only required permissions.
  - Store CI secrets in encrypted vaults, not plain environment variables.

## 9. Dependency Management
- **Vet Third-Party Libraries**
  - Choose actively maintained packages (Next.js, Drizzle ORM, shadcn/ui).
- **Vulnerability Scanning**
  - Integrate SCA tools (Dependabot, Snyk) to detect CVEs in dependencies.
- **Lockfiles**
  - Commit `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to ensure deterministic builds.
- **Minimize Footprint**
  - Remove unused dependencies to reduce the attack surface.

## 10. Testing & Monitoring
- **Automated Tests**
  - Unit tests for validation logic (Zod schemas).
  - Integration tests for authentication flows and voting restrictions (e.g., student can vote only once).
- **Continuous Security Testing**
  - Run static analysis (ESLint with security plugins) and dynamic scanning (OWASP ZAP) in CI.
- **Runtime Monitoring & Alerts**
  - Centralize logs (ELK/EFK stack). Set alerts for anomalous events (multiple failed tokens, rate limit breaches).
